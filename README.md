# landingPage

This is my landing page assignment for The Odin Project

## Goal
The goal of this project is to be able to build a complete layout from scratch, including all html and css; making it similar to the one provided by The Odin Project.
All along this project I will also be pushing my web page to github so I learn how to version control my developments

## list of things I do in order to achieve my goal
1. create html and css files.
2. create img folder
3. I created a Kanban board to follow the progress of my project
4. I have been using a lot of flexbox to do the hero section. It is still causing me trouble how to format properly all the subsections on it
5. In the body sections I will apply the flexbox model on as many sections as possible
6. 2023-03-08 I learned today that I need to select all font weights that I want to use for my website in the google font page
7. 2023-03-09 I encountered a problem today. the hero section moves independently to the header section, my objective is to block them both so they grow and shrink at the same rate
